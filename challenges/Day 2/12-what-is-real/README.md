After discovering where the srite originated, you reach out to your friend to try to figure out a little bit more about the analyst you replaced. You learn that the man was a former high level intelligence officer working for the us government. He worked specifically on a project known to the public as MK Ultra. While he never talked about it, his military jacket contained the information that led directly to the same date and time when the project took place.
