# #8 The Alert

## Description

You think to yourself "What is the connection?"   

You remember it is your first day, but you want to dig deeper into this. Your e-mail box has been pinging for the last hour while you've been tracking down these leads and it's almost time for lunch.  

You take a quick look and see one from your boss with the subject line "Mandatory training- Need done before you return from lunch" 

The email reads: 

Welcome aboard.  

We want to keep you sharp and make sure you stay up to date on the latest and greatest training. We need you to visit this site https://www.mrsosint.com/ and figure out who the "OG" is.  

Or pack up your cubicle and head home.  

Staff  

P.s. Have a great first and maybe last day! 

Who is the OG? 

FLAG{XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX} 



A google search for the founder of the OSINT academy led me to Cynthia Hetherington's LinkedIn page which confirmed this flag.
