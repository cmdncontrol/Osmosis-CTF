# # 5 The E-mail

## Description

As you soak in what you just heard from your new co-worker you think how happy you are to have finally entered the world of Cyber Security. While working as the supply chain analyst wasn't your first choice, you know how important it is and know how every role is important.  

As you log in for the first time you suddenly get a notification that you have a new email.  

The text from the email (Full email attached):  

"Mr. Anderson, 

The package is on the plane and in motion. I trust I don't need to remind you of the importance of this operation. Everything is going smoothly so far, but I expect everyone to stay sharp and ready. 

No screw-ups, no loose ends. We’ve come too far to let anything slip now. The package will arrive as planned, and we need to be ready for the next steps immediately. 

Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. 

-Smith"
