# # 7 The Link

## Description

While looking at the spot and realizing everything it represents you suddenly see something odd. You see 21 circles all linked together as if they were a chain. Directly below them are two words. What are they?

FLAG{XXX XXXXX}
Notice that their is a space between the two words, not a _ or - simply a space. 



If we use google street view and travel to the spot of the incident, as you maneuveur around the area you'll notice a building with a bunch of linked circles.
