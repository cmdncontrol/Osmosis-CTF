# # 1 Instructions to the game

## Description

Thanks for jOining us in the not first but second OSMOSIS Capture The Flag. This is going to be a lot of fun with some really aweSome prizes. Prizes are so awesome they made me sIgn a NDA, can you believe that?  As you will see this may be the only challeNge you can see; and their is a big giant #1 nexT to the name of the title. So keep in mind, it is going to be best practice to go in the order oF the challenges or you may have no idea what is happening. So dO be suRe to know what's goinG on. Can yOu get this first flag right using the fOrmat explaineD in the audio clip?
